# ðŸŽµ Music Stories ðŸŽµ

 I created this app for the final project submission in Codepath's Web Development course.

## Why
The idea of the app is to provide a space for users to share the memories they might associate with a piece of music. I love music and have lots of memories that I associate with different songs. I figured others might have simmilar experiences with music and this is a platform designed to share these experiences. 

## Tech stack 

This project is built using **React** and **Supabase**. Supports the basic Create, Read, Update and Delete operations for user posts. It also has search, voting, and sorting functionalities for posts.
